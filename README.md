# 🎶 Music of the Day

**Music of the Day** is an end-to-end generative system that transforms the *semantic state of daily news* into an expressive ensemble composition.

Each day, the project ingests real-world events, analyzes their meaning and dynamics, and produces a unique piece of music that reflects how the world feels *today* — while remembering how it felt *yesterday*.

> *A living musical diary of global semantics.*

## ✨ What It Does

On every run, the system:

1. 📰 Fetches daily news from configurable RSS sources  
2. 🧠 Embeds and analyzes semantic meaning  
3. 📈 Tracks change, novelty, and narrative momentum over time  
4. 🎼 Maps semantic features to musical intent  
5. 🎹 Composes expressive music (MIDI)  
6. 🔊 Renders high-quality audio (WAV)  
7. 📝 Writes a natural-language explanation of the result  

All in **one command**.

## 🧠 Semantic Layer

### News Ingestion
- Pulls articles via RSS feeds (configured in `configs/sources.yaml`)
- Normalizes and cleans text
- Designed for extensibility (additional sources, APIs)

### Embeddings
- Uses transformer-based sentence embeddings (e.g. **All-mpnet-base-v2**)
- Produces per-article vectors
- Aggregates into a **daily semantic embedding**

### Semantic Features

The system extracts interpretable features such as:

- **Semantic shift** – how much today diverges from recent history  
- **Semantic novelty** – how unusual today’s topics are  
- **Topic structure**
  - Number of topics
  - Topic dominance
  - Topic entropy  
- **Intra-day dispersion** – diversity within today’s news  
- **Semantic velocity** – day-over-day movement  
- **Semantic acceleration** – change in velocity  
- **Narrative phase** – inferred global state  
  (`build_up`, `climax`, `aftermath`, `stasis`)

### Temporal Memory
- Daily embeddings are persisted
- Rolling averages supported
- Semantic velocity stored across days
- Enables continuity and long-form evolution

## 🎼 Semantics → Music Mapping

Semantic features are translated into **musical intent**, expressed as high-level forces that guide composition rather than fixed musical facts:

- **Harmonic color** (bright / dark / ambiguous)
- **Base tempo** (global pacing anchor)
- **Dynamic intensity curve** (energy over time)
- **Tension curve** (harmonic and emotional pressure)
- **Texture density curve** (orchestration thickness)
- **Emotional vector** *(valence, arousal, tension)*
- **Motion profile** (`drift`, `rise`, `wave`, `collapse`)
- **Duration** (overall temporal scale)

Instead of prescribing notes or keys directly, this layer shapes how the music *behaves* over time—serving as the creative bridge between semantic meaning and audible form.

## 🎹 Music Generation

### Composition

Music is generated from `MusicIntent` using **instrument-specific renderers** built on `pretty_midi`.  
Rather than a single solo instrument, the system produces a small **ensemble texture** driven by shared semantic curves.

- Intent-driven MIDI generation using `pretty_midi`
- Multi-instrument ensemble:
  - Piano
  - Strings
  - Bass
  - Percussion
- Time-discretized rendering over semantic frames
- Probabilistic note triggering based on texture density
- Expressive control derived from intent curves:
  - **Intensity curve** → velocity and energy
  - **Density curve** → note activation probability
  - **Tension curve** → harmonic and registral pressure
  - **Motion profile** → long-range musical behavior

Musical techniques include:
- Curve-shaped dynamics over time
- Density-weighted texture emergence
- Energy-driven harmonic tension
- Narrative-aware motion (`drift`, `rise`, `wave`, `collapse`)
- Stochastic variation for organic output

## 🧪 Tests

Run the full test suite:

```bash
pytest
```

Includes tests for:

- Semantic feature extraction

- News ingestion (mocked)

- Music generation

## 🔁 Automation

The project is designed to support:

- Daily scheduled runs (e.g. GitHub Actions)

- Artifact uploads (MIDI, WAV, explanations)

- Long-term semantic and musical continuity

## 🎨 Philosophy

### Music of the Day is not about turning news headlines into literal sounds.

It’s about capturing the motion of meaning —
how ideas shift, collide, accelerate, and settle —
and letting that motion leave a trace in music.

Some days are calm. Some days are tense.
This system listens — and plays.
